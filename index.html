            <h2>My Tech Goals For The Next 2 Years</h2>
            <p>Hello, my name is Farouk. I am a Software Engineer, an Electrical Engineer, a Backend Developer and I love to code.
                I have great critical thinking and problem solving abilities. I love solving puzzles, Wordles, and taking on new challenges. I would spend 80 minutes writing scripts to solve a task that could have taken me 20 minutes. Now, I can always finish subsequent ones without ever doing them.
                When I'm not coding, you will find me doing sports or some exercise. I play basketball and I consider myself a decent player; averaging 14 PPG - mostly because my opponents are below average. I love music, walking, exercising, brainstorming and I am a potterhead. With a dedication to both my craft and a healthy lifestyle, I bring a well-rounded approach to every project, delivering creative and technically sound solutions.
                My friends call me fabio but you can call me 0xfab10 - if you speak Hex. Skills & Tools</p>
